## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Michele Fresneda Alarcon, I am a PhD student in the Neutrophil lab (@LivNeutrophil) at the Universtity of Liverpool. I am looking at the metabolome of neutrophils using proton NMR to determine key differences between healthy and rheumatoid arhtitis patients.
In addition to my research I am interested in data analysis, machin learning models and development of apps (shiny) for slick and fast reporting.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
apart from my PhD project (which takes alot of my time)
- [**beetlesNMR**](https://github.com/mikies21/beetlesNMR): an R package which for analysis of NMR metabolomics data based on my reporting needs which include scaling and normalisation, PCA and PLS-DA plots, PLS-DA classification metrics, correlation reliability score, and much more.
- ShinybeetleNMR: a shiny app built upon the beetlesNMR package which provides quick reporting and fast data exploration. without the need to work directly with R and Rstudio
- Other side projects involving shiny applications
- learning python in my spare time

### âš¡ Fun facts:
- I'm an ex gymnast and can still do all sort of flips. My favourite apparatus was the high bar and I competed in the Italia Serie A (premier league) of gymnastics
- I speak fluetly English, Italian and Spanish
- I had no coding experience before March 2020 (when the pandemic started) and now I'm hooked on it
- I appreciate good memes
